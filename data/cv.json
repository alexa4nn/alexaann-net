    "a living index of my research and creative practice": "Alexa Ann Bonomo is an artist, curator, educator, and scholar with a deep interest in methods of preservation, archiving, and worldbuilding. Her creative work primarily lives on the internet and ephemeral settings in the form of net art, short film, real-time live performance visuals, creative writing, and other community driven projects. Alexa focuses on process around craftsmanship, the handmade, and other methods that are long and laborious, including long walking pilgrimages. Heavily influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement and Situationist International movement of the post-industrial age, she often performs her own impermanence through a siren scream plea for morality and health of a world poisoned by insidious artificial networks and surveillance states. Through a revival of natural motifs, symbolism of flora and fauna, and ornamentation, her work reveres nature and the divine's grace granted to us, and reveals a sense of sulleness upon seeing such grace in active decay. Some of her work has been exhibited and presented in Le Cube Garges in Paris, Centre de Cultura Contempor?nia in Barcelona, Montreal Conference Centre in Montreal, and the Exploratorium and Gray Area in San Francisco. Alexa teaches at The University of San Francisco in the Art Department and is the curator of underneath.study, a wayfaring learning + arts collective. Along with other design and dev side projects, she spends her studio time crafting lore and researching motion capture for performance based art in the World Engines Lab.",
